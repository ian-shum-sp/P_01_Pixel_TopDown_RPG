This game is inspired by the game play originated from the reference linked in the Reference section.

## Overview
First RPG is a Role Play Game (RPG) with the player having the ability to level up, purchase equipments and go through adventure maps to fight different type of enemies.

## Character Creation and Customisation
You can customise your character's name and gender when you first started the game. 

## Maps
There are 3 different central hubs in this game: Dungeon, Enchanted Forest and Fantasy. Each central hub gives access to their respective adventure site: Deep Dungeon, Enchanted Forest and Fantasy Land. You can easily switch between central hubs by using the portal in the hub. Each central hub also has its unique Armorer, Weaponsmith and Potion Brewer/Merchant, with some special equipments in store ready to be picked up by the player.

## Armor, Weapon and Potion
There are 3 types of armors available in the game: Head Armor, Chest Armor and Boots Armor. Each armor has different armor points for damage reductions, and may have buffs with additional effects. Player can purchase/sell armor from the Armorer.  

There are 2 types of weapons: Melee and Ranged. Each weapon has their own unique attack animations, attack speed, damage points, attack range, and may have debuffs on it that will be applied to the units the player attacks. Player can purchase/sell armor from the Weaponsmith. 

For potions, you can get potions will different buffs from the Potion Brewer/Merchant. Potion must be equipped in the pouch to use it, and player can only use the potions equipped in the pouch when he/she is in the adventure site. The player can only equip/unequip potion to/from pouch in central hubs. Each potion can have different effect duration and cooldown. 

## Buffs and Debuffs
There are 3 types of debuffs in this game, which are Bleeding, Knockback and Element. Bleeding and Element debuffs deal damage over time, with Bleeding reducing speed and Element reducing damage output as secondary effect.  

To counter debuffs, there are 5 buffs in the game, which are Bleeding Resistance, Knockback Resistance, Element Resistance, Strength and Speed. Buffs can be gained permanently through armors or by temporarily through the consumption of potions.

## Mobs
The mobs are categorised into 4 categories: Tiny, Mediumn, Large and Boss. Upon defeating a mob, player will gain experience and gold, where he/she can level up and spend gold to buy more armors or weapon. Each mob has its own armor points, movement speed, attack animation, attack speed, damage points, and also may have debuffs on their attack. Mobs will be triggered when the player enters a specific range and it will chase for a fixed range, depending on the type of mobs. 

## Notes
Currently this game is playable but with minimum features only. There might be continous update on this game. Possible updates to include:  
1. Quest line (with a quest menu)
2. Enhance animation of characters, mobs
3. Enhance map and level designs
4. More rooms for exploration

Updates will be recorded in the Design file in the Documents directory. I will also provide updates (if any) on top of this file.  
For the latest stats of the weapons, armors and mobs etc, kindly take a look into the Stats.md file in the Documents directory. That file will contain most of the stats related items in the game.
